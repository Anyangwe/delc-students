            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p> My name is Thalya Therese and I am currently on my journey to become a frontend developer based in Cameroon. I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform. I also believe it is important to understand both design and development to achieve a successful user-facing product. By involving a front-end developer and designing skills, technical challenges can be achieved at maximum time hence, producing a more cohesive product and holistic engagement in the most time efficient manner.Aside this, I am a climate change activist who is passionate about sustainable development and also ways to combat emissions of greenhouse gases as well as detoriation of the environment at large.</p>
